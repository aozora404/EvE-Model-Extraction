# EvE Model Extraction
Included are a set of files to extract 3D models from EVE Online.

## Setup
To set folder, point to \EVE\sharedcache\tq

Ship models are located in \dx9\model\ship\

.gr2 files are the model data.

.dds files are the texture data.

## Model
The included TriExporter supports exporting .gr2 to .obj, .3ds, and a few other formats (File>Export model...). Use that.

For some reason, the UV map for the models are upside down (at least in Blender). To fix this, use the UV editor, select all vertices and scale -1 in the Y axis. 

## Texture
The usual texture maps are packed into different channels inside several .dds files, namely those ending with \_ar, \_no, and \_pdmg.

### Breakdown

#### \_ar file:

RGB : Albedo

A   : Glossiness (inverse of roughness)

#### \_no file:

G   : Normal map X

A   : Normal map Y

B   : Ambient Occlusion

#### \_pmdg file:

R   : Paint

G   : Material

B   : Dirt

A   : Glow

(Note: R=Red, G=Green, B=Blue, A=Alpha)

You can use an image processing software (such as GIMP) to separate all of these out manually. Using GIMP,

1) Open the file
2) Decompose the image (Color>Components>Decompose) (Color model RGBA, Decompose to layers checked).
2.1) (For Albedo map) Compose (Color>Components>Compose) with Color model RGB and channels corresponding to the layers.
2.2) (For Normal map) Compose (Color>Components>Compose) with Color model RGB, Red channel as green layer, Green channel as alpha layer, and Blue channel as Mask value (255).
2.3) (For Roughness map) Invert the colors by Right-click>Colors>Invert.
4) Export as .png.

Alternatively, you can directly process (most) .dds files inside Blender with relative ease thanks to the node-based shading system it uses.

### How to unpack (Blender):

_An implementation of the method listed below can be found inside the included sample file, named Marshal_Direct.blend._

Import the .dds files with the Image Texture node and separate the channels with a Separate RGB node.

#### Color
1) Plug the material map (\_pdmg G) into a Color Ramp node (constant interpolation, stops at (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75), color can be arbitrary). The color ramp determines the base color of the model.
2) Add 1) and the paint map (\_pdmg R) with the MixRGB node (Add, factor 1).
3) Multiply the AO map (\_no B) and the albedo map (\_ar RGB) with the MixRGB node (Multiply, factor 1).
4) Multiply 2) and 3) with the MixRGB node (Multiply, factor 1).
5) Multiply 4) and the dirt map (\_pdmg B) with the MixRGB node (Multiply, factor arbitrary).
6) Plug into Base Color input

#### Metallic
1) Plug the material map (\_pdmg G) into a Color Ramp node (constant interpolation, stops at (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75), color black for non-metal and white for metal.
2) Plug into Metallic input

#### Roughness
Unfortunately, the Roughness map cannot be processed directly inside Blender. Use the method listed above to extract the roughness map in GIMP and continue as below.

1) (Optional) Clamp the value of the roughness with the Math node (Multiply, check Clamp, value arbitrary (default 1)). This is to tone the how rough the texture will be.
2) Plug into Roughness input


#### Emission
1) Plug the glow map (\_pmdg A) into a Color Ramp node (ease interpolation, stops at (0, arbitrary), color black and arbitrary, respectively).
2) Plug into Emission input

#### Normal
Unfortunately, the normal map cannot be processed directly inside Blender. Use the method listed above to extract the normal map in GIMP and continue as below.

1) Plug the normal map into a Normal Map node (Tangent Space, strength arbitrary)
2) Plug into Normal input
