## Setup
To set folder, point to \EVE\sharedcache\tq

Ship models are located in \dx9\model\ship\

.gr2 files are the model data.

.dds files are the texture data.

## Model
The included TriExporter supports exporting .gr2 to .obj, .3ds, and a few other formats (File>Export model...). Use that.

For some reason, the UV map for the models are upside down (at least in Blender). To fix this, use the UV editor, select all vertices and scale -1 in the Y axis. 

## Texture
The usual texture maps are packed into different channels inside several .dds files, namely those ending with \_ar, \_no, and \_pdmg.

### Breakdown

#### \_ar file:

RGB : Albedo

A   : Roughness

#### \_no file:

GA  : Normal map

B   : Ambient Occlusion

#### \_pmdg file:

R   : Paint

G   : Material

B   : Dirt

A   : Glow

(Note: R=Red, G=Green, B=Blue, A=Alpha)

### How to unpack (Blender):

Separate the channels of \_pmdg with a Separate RGB node.

#### Color
1) Plug the material map (\_pdmg G) into a Color Ramp node (constant interpolation, stops at (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75), color can be arbitrary). The color ramp determines the base color of the model.
2) Add 1) and the paint map (\_pdmg R) with the MixRGB node (Add, factor 1).
3) Subtract the AO map (\_no B) (color1) and the albedo map (\_ar RGB) (color2) with the MixRGB node (Subtract, factor 0.2).
4) Multiply 2) and 3) with the MixRGB node (Multiply, factor 1).
5) Multiply 4) and the dirt map (\_pdmg B) with the MixRGB node (Multiply, factor arbitrary).
6) Plug into Base Color input

#### Metallic
1) Plug the material map (\_pdmg G) into a Color Ramp node (constant interpolation, stops at 0 and where the metallic cutoff is (match with color output), color black and white, respectively).
2) Plug into Metallic input

#### Roughness
~~1) Invert the roughness map (\_ar A) with the Invert node (factor 1).~~
~~2) Clamp the output of 1) with the Math node (Multiply, check Clamp, value arbitrary (default 1)). This is to tone the how rough the texture will be.~~
~~3) Plug into Roughness input~~
Currently doesn't work, and I don't know why.

#### Emission
1) Plug the glow map (\_pmdg A) into a Color Ramp node (ease interpolation, stops at (0, arbitrary), color black and arbitrary, respectively).
2) Plug into Emission input

#### Normal
The normal map cannot be processed directly inside Blender. The following will use GIMP, but any image editing software should be fine.

(In GIMP)

1) Decompose the \_no file (Color>Components>Decompose) (Color model RGBA, Decompose to layers checked).
2) Compose (Color>Components>Compose) with Red channel as green layer, Green channel as alpha layer, and Blue channel as Mask value (255).
3) Export as .png.

(In Blender)

4) Plug the normal map into a Normal Map node (Tangent Space, strength arbitrary)
5) Plug into Normal input
